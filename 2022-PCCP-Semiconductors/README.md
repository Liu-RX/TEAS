# A caveat of the charge-extrapolation scheme for modeling electrochemical reactions on semiconductor surfaces: an issue induced by a discontinuous Fermi level change

(Photo)electrochemical surface reactions in realistic experimental systems occur under a constant-
potential condition, while the ab initio simulations of electrochemical reactions are mostly performed
under a constant-charge condition. A charge-extrapolation scheme proposed by earlier theoretical
studies converts constant-charge reaction energies to constant-potential reaction energies for
electrochemical reactions on metal surfaces, which is based on a capacitor-model assumption to
approximate the surface electrical double layer. However, the charge-extrapolation approach may be
problematic when applied to models of photoelectrochemical reactions on semiconductor surfaces with
a cross-bandgap Fermi level change along the reaction path. We perform density-functional-theory
calculations to show that the error is induced by an abrupt change of the modeling systemâ€™s potential
making the capacitor model assumption invalid. We further propose an approach to avoid the cross-
bandgap Fermi level change in the simulations of semiconductor surface reactions, with which the
charge-extrapolation scheme still can be employed to compute the constant-potential reaction
energies for the semiconductor photoelectrode cases.
