Carbon nanotubes are quasi-one-dimensional systems that possess large electronic conductance (for the metallic variants), high mechanical strength, selective emission and detection of light, and can be made
chemically functionalized. In this work, we generalize the notion of disorder hyperuniformity, a recently
discovered exotic state of matter with hidden long-range order, to quasi-one-dimensional materials. As a proof
of concept, we then apply the generalized framework to quantify the density fluctuations in amorphous carbon
nanotubes containing randomly distributed Stone-Wales defects. We demonstrate that all of these amorphous
nanotubes are hyperuniform; i.e., the infinite-wavelength (normalized) density fluctuations of these systems are
completely suppressed, regardless of the diameter, rolling axis, number of rolling sheets, and defect fraction
of the nanotubes. We find that these amorphous nanotubes are energetically more stable than nanotubes with
periodically distributed Stone-Wales defects. Moreover, certain semiconducting defect-free carbon nanotubes
become metallic as sufficiently large amounts of defects are randomly introduced. This structural study of
amorphous nanotubes strengthens our fundamental understanding of these systems, and suggests possible exotic
physical properties, as endowed by their disordered hyperuniformity. Our findings also shed light on the effect
of dimensionality reduction on the hyperuniformity property of materials.

## Contents

There are three folders, named `1_DHU`, `2_defect_model_I`, and `3_defect_model_II`, which contain input files and carbon nanotube configurations for the DHU model and another two defect models.

In the three folders, there are some subfolders whose names represent the concentration of the Stone-Wales defects.
